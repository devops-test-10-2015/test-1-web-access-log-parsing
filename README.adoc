=== Log format

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_log_config.html

"%a %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b %D"

== Plan

* Get the sample logs
* Write the requirements
* Done =========================================
* Testing
** Take a small part of the log and manually count the up the values and use that for testing.
* Solution - go with ELK stack
** Create logstash conf to parse the logs
** Try to get the results with the metrics plugin
** If that is not possible then look at elastic search
** If that is going to take too much time then consider a script that uses the output from logstash
* Documentation
